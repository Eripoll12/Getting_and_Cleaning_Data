## Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

 - id: (integer) the subject ID.
 - activity: (string) the activity name:
    - Walking
    - Walking Upstairs
    - Walking Downstairs
    - Sitting
    - Standing
    - Laying

## Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. All values are floating point numbers.
